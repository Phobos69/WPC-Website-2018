                <li>Zambia has an open, regulated electricity market that allows for private generators, transmission and distribution companies.</li>
                <li>It is a member of the Southern Africa Power Pool (“SAPP”) and has interconnectors with Zimbabwe, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. An interconnector with Tanzania granting access to the East African Power Pool is under development while an interconnector with Malawi is planned.</li>
                <li>ZESCO Ltd, the state utility, is currently the major player.</li>
                <li>The Project will improve stability in the western part of ZESCO’s grid and is estimated to reduce overall grid losses by up to 15 MW.</li>
                <li>Zambia has 2.8GW of installed capacity. In 2016 generation was 11.6TWhr of which approximately 90% was from hydropower stations.</li>
                <li>In 2016 2TWhr was imported to meet demand and there was a significant shortage of generation leading to power cuts across the network.</li>
                <li>The Government’s National Energy Policy (“NEP”) has set a goal to achieve 60% electricity access by 2030. Current electrification levels are c. 30%, of which rural levels are c. 6%.</li>

                <li>Power Evacuation study completed in 2013 in conjunction with ZESCO Transmission and Grid Integration Study finalised in 2017.</li>
                <li>Existing 66 kV line passing by the station can take only 30 MW.</li>
                <li>Zesco propose to construct a new 220 kV transmission line from Sesheke to Mongu to strengthen the western Zambian grid which will pass within 5km of the Ngonye project to strengthen the Western Zambian grid.</li>
                <li>WPC will construct approximately 5km of 220kV transmission line to connect to this Zesco line.</li>
                <li>WPC is working with Zesco on a fall-back step-in plan should Zesco not have finance ready to start in time.</li>
