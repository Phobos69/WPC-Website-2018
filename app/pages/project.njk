                <li>A 180 MW run-of-river hydroelectric power scheme on the Zambezi River in Western Province of Zambia.</li>
                <li>To generate 855 GWh per year of clean, renewable energy for local demand and export. Equivalent to the power requirements of 750,000 Zambian households.</li>
                <li>A partnership with the community of the Western Province.</li>
                <li>A $500m investment with an expected EPC construction cost of US$300m â€“ US$350m, the largest ever private investment in Western Zambia.</li>
                <li>Financial close in Q4 2019.</li>
                <li>36-month construction period.</li>

                <li>A complex hydrological system managed through comprehensive survey, data analysis and modelling.</li>
                <li>Daily gauge data from 1924 (Livingstone), 1947 (Senanga) and 2007 (Sioma) acquired and processed.</li>
                <li>Four river gauges installed at the project site operated continuously since 2012.</li>
                <li>Multiple rounds of bathymetric and Acoustic Doppler Current Profile (ADCP) survey across the project site.</li>
                <li>Computer hydrodynamic model constructed for scenario testing, environmental impact assessment and energy modelling.</li>
                <li>Flow in the Zambezi is strongly seasonal with a flood peak in April and low flow from July through to January.</li>
                <li>Higher flows cause the water level in the gorge downstream of the falls to rise and reduces power generation head.</li>
                <li>There is a significant variation from year to year in the flow of the river depending on rainfall upstream in the catchment.</li>
                <li>But increasing head at decreasing flows means that the power output shows considerably less variation from year to year.</li>
                <li>Coefficient of variation flow: 36%, Coefficient of variation energy: 12%.</li>
